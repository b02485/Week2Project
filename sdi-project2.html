<p>In this story I decided to talk about my recent car purchase, and the way code can explain the process of buying a car.</p>
<p>I first went out and checked out my 3 favorite cars in the class I was looking for which is the mid-size sedan range, and all with in my price range. Obviously since I talked in my last story about my daughter, I needed something that would be great for her as well, something that is safe and plenty of leg room. </p>
<p>So basically this going to explain the process of applying for a loan and getting approved for the car that I want. Enjoy</p>
